                <strong>Description</strong><br><br>
                Sori is a speech behavior app designed to help users build self-awareness in how they communicate.
                By integrating with AirPods, it delivers <strong>real-time voice analysis</strong> and a <strong>personalized dashboard</strong> that reflects tone, pacing, and word patterns without interrupting conversations.<br><br>
                As the <strong>UI/UX Designer</strong>, I led the design process in Figma, shaping the app's structure, interface, and user flows. My focus was on making feedback intuitive, unobtrusive, and actionable.<br>
                <strong>Puren Kim</strong>, the <strong>Product Manager</strong>, guided the product direction by defining core problem space and prioritizing features, which allowed me to design a more focused and impactful solution.

                <strong>Background</strong><br><br>
                Understanding how we speak, and how it affects our interactions, is surprisingly hard.
                While communication drives daily life, people rarely get immediate, meaningful feedback on their tone, word choice, or speech patterns.
                Misunderstandings, repetitive phrasing, and unintentional tone shifts can go unnoticed, leaving users unaware of how they present themselves in conversations.
                Sori was created to give users a contextual, real-time reflection of their speech behavior, helping them improve self-awareness and communication skills naturally.

                <strong>Scope</strong><br><br>
                Despite the prevalence of voice-driven technology, there's a gap:<br>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Passive awareness</strong>: Most tools require active engagement or logging to understand speech patterns.<br></li>
                    <li><strong>Behavioral reflection</strong>: Users don't get insights about tone, pacing, or frequent words in daily conversation.<br></li>
                    <li><strong>Personalization</strong>: Existing solutions rarely adapt to a user's unique speech style or conversational context.<br></li>
                </ul>
                <strong>Opportunity</strong>: Build a personal auditory copilot that observes, interprets, and guides users in real time, without interrupting daily life.

                <strong>The Problem</strong><br><br>
                How might we help users understand their speech habits, discover patterns, and improve self-awareness through an always-on, privacy-safe interface?

                <strong>Research</strong><br><br>
                To define the feature, we explored:<br>
                <ul>
                    <li>How do people currently track their speech behavior?</li>
                    <li>What challenges exist in gaining real-time, actionable feedback?</li>
                </ul>
                We conducted interviews with 5 frequent AirPods users and sent a survey to 30 students.<br><br>
                Key Insights:<br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Users are unaware of tone shifts or filler words during conversations.</li>
                    <li>Passive tools often feel invasive or cumbersome.</li>
                    <li>Contextual insights (conversation length, interaction patterns) are more useful than generic analytics.</li>

                <strong>Always-on, yet unobtrusive</strong><br>
                We focused on subtle notifications and ambient awareness, ensuring users felt informed but not distracted.<br><br>
                <strong>Actionable personalization</strong><br>
                Insights were designed to be meaningful, visually digestible, and specific to individual behavior.<br><br>
                <strong>Collaboration & Development</strong><br>
                Puren and I worked closely to bring Sori to life. Puren defined the product vision, prioritized features, and ensured the solution addressed real user needs. I translated these insights into a cohesive UI/UX design, creating intuitive flows, a personalized dashboard, and visual feedback mechanisms. Together, we iterated rapidly on prototypes, aligning design and functionality to deliver an unobtrusive, user-centered speech behavior tool.
